    <p id="foss-def">
      Free and open-source software (FOSS) is a term used to refer to groups of software consisting of both free software and open-source software where anyone is freely licensed to use, study, modify and change the software in any way and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software.

<h3>History</h3>
  <p>
    In 1983, frustrated with the shift towards proprietary software, <b>Richard Stallman</b> announced the GNU project to develop a free and open-source operating system. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) was founded in 1985 to oversee the project, and Stallman published the GNU Manifesto the same year. The manifesto introduced the Free Software Definition and "copyleft" ideas, promoting the "Four Essential Freedoms" of free software: use, study, modify, and distribute. The FSF's work has had a significant impact on the tech industry, fostering a culture of open collaboration and innovation.

    In 1991, Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as freely modifiable source code. Initially, it wasn't released under a Free software or Open-source software license. However, with version 0.12 in February 1992, he relicensed the project under the GNU General Public License.
  </p>
  <p>
    FreeBSD and NetBSD (both derived from 386BSD) were released as Free software when the USL v. BSDi lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993. OpenBSD forked from NetBSD in 1995. Also in 1995, The Apache HTTP Server, commonly referred to as Apache, was released under the Apache License 1.0
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1997, Eric Raymond published The Cathedral and the Bazaar, a reflective analysis of the hacker community and Free software principles. The paper received significant attention in early 1998, and was one factor in motivating Netscape Communications Corporation to release their popular Netscape Communicator Internet suite as Free software. This code is today better known as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird
